                                                        For the past 10 years, I have worked creating pretty and responsive web pages 
                                                        and applications. I've been involved in every step of the making process, 
                                                        trying to always put the user's needs first and make it accessible to anyone.<br/>
                                                        But I've been obsessed with technology, visual arts and storytelling from a very young age;
                                                        and since then, I haven't stopped studying those fields, 
                                                        on the technical side, and more recently, on the visual one.
                                                        Now it would be my pleasure to use my experience and creativity to help anyone to create their 
                                                        dream product.

                                                        I created my first website back in the 2000s, 
                                                        I basically downloaded Cartoon Network's web page and changed the titles and pictures,
                                                        and uploaded it to a blogging site. I received an email from CN's headquarters saying 
                                                        they were going to sue, I was 10.
                                                        Later in life, I believe one of my first experiences with ui design was my College's 
                                                        powerpoint presentations. I enjoyed going a little extra with the use of hyperlinks, 
                                                        effects and videos, which now, I understand as interaction design.

                                                I have navigated several fields in this world, but my natural curiosity 
                                                for how things work has been constant; hence my interests in spacetime 
                                                and science in general. I also love that, as humans, we are able to express 
                                                almost anything using different media. More personally, 
                                                I have explored the world of Drag, using my Drag persona as a vehicle to tell stories. 
                                                I may say I'm a scientist with an artistic heart.

                                                Last thing I would like to share about me is the importance I give to inclusivity as a designer,
                                                and this resonates personally with me from my core self. As an LGBTQ person, who grew up in a small town, 
                                                in a difficult environment, I understand the importance of including historically marginalized humans, 
                                                and I try to keep that in mind  when designing. I loved connecting all the dots that lead me 
                                                to where I am today, and in the end, using my job as my life purpose to create a better, more functional 
                                                world, for everyone.
