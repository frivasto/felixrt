                                        I'll tell you how I brought an static Website into a modern

                                        powered by SEO and SEM to boost its performance.

                                        The heart of PentaLogix are its CAD Software Products, 
                                        specially its star product
                                        "Viewmate" which is popular among PCB designers. 
                                        But Agustin, the owner, wanted
                                        to transform PL to not just be a PCB Software company,
                                        but also a PCB seller. So we designed
                                        a PCB Manufacturing product page and 
                                        several PCB products that were siblings to their
                                        Software Product, and we founded a way 
                                        that when people landed to view a product 
                                        we also displayed their counterpart.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                </div>
                                <div className="col-sm-12 px-sm-3 col-lg-5 offset-lg-1 my-3 px-2">

                                </div>

                                    Then we took Agustin's old SmartDFM which asked for a zip file containing all 
                                    the PCB technical specs and their email, so one of their workers could 
                                    open it and then respond to the end user with a personalized quote. 
                                    We proposed an online quote that asked for their technical specs, 
                                    and started consuming their already filled specs vs prices database.

                                        We did a couple of iterations and ended up realizing the users 
                                        barely changed some of the specs, so we decided to reduce the 
                                        specs options and present more quantity and lead times per price.

                                        Similar to this, I designed and FrontEnded all the other quoting PCB products and the rest of Software products. And again, I did a couple of more things for PL...

                                      I also started tracking
                                      how people were searching to get to our pages by integrating Google Analytics.
                                      From there I was able to realize people were responding to the several 
                                      keywords, so all the pages were transformed to talk about those keywords
                                     in a meaningful way that was also informative for the users. A Video and
                                      a Blog section was created to generate Inbound and Outbound linking and 
                                      I also introduced the header, footer, article and several other semantic 
                                      tags. 

                                    </p>

                                    With the analytics data I was able to generate the Paid Search acquisition channel which elevated the conversion 
                                    ]rates by more than 50% when active, besides starting several types of Email Marketing campaigns.

                                    The entire approach of the page was changed to visualize a multi product 
                                    centered e-commerce, 
                                    and Analytics proved that right after the shift, New Users curve started to grow.
